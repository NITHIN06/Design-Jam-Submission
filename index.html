                    <h1>Ragnar Lathbrok</h1><br>
                    <p>Ragnar was complicated man, a restless warrior, and the former King of Kattegat. He claimed to be a escendant of the Norse god Odin, the god of slain warriors, but also the god of eternal curiosity.</p><p>Ragnar was born and raised in the lands near Kattegat, in southern Norway, and earned a reputation as a clever boy.</p><p> Ragnar is more like a mythological character such as the legendary King Arthur. Ragnar’s name has appeared several times in Norse mythology, but that doesn’t make his existence to be real. There is no question that the Vikings existed, but Ragnar’s status as a human Viking leader is highly debatable. Even if he existed as a real person, there are still doubts as to whether he went by that name.</p>
