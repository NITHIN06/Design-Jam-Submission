                        <h1>Ragnar Lathbrok</h1><br>
                        <p>Ragnar was complicated man, a restless warrior, and the former King of Kattegat. He claimed to be a escendant of the Norse god Odin, the god of slain warriors, but also the god of eternal curiosity.</p><p>Ragnar was born and raised in the lands near Kattegat, in southern Norway, and earned a reputation as a clever boy.</p><p> Ragnar is more like a mythological character such as the legendary King Arthur. Ragnar’s name has appeared several times in Norse mythology, but that doesn’t make his existence to be real. There is no question that the Vikings existed, but Ragnar’s status as a human Viking leader is highly debatable.</p>

                        <h1>Achievments</h1><br>
                        <p>The ambush of the river as the first confrontation between the Viking and the Wessex marked a decisive victory over the Saxon soldiers, which subsequently followed the invasion of Wessex and the looting of Winchester by the Vikings.</p><p> Having turned Rollo against Ragnar and defying King Horik in land disputes, Ragnar's forces of Kattegat set their sights on the renegade Viking Yarg Born, who vows to take the lands for himself. This battle is awesome in that it sees many of our heroes taking part in the fight alongside one-another, including Floki, Rollo, and Lagertha. It also sees the debut of Ragnar's son Björn in combat.</p>

                    <h2>Have a Relentless Pursuit of Knowledge</h2>
                    <p>Have a relentless pursuit of knowledge. He didn’t know what was to the west — he had only heard rumours and tales. His curiosity led him to discover more. But to traverse the great sea, he would need a boat that could handle the power of the ocean and a way to navigate safely. He was just a simple farmer, he did not have any knowledge of boat building or navigation. But he learned. he found a way to ingeniously navigate safely and accurately.</p><br>
                    <h2> Exercise Humility</h2>
                    <p>Ragnar was at times arrogant, conceited, and narrow-minded; however, when it mattered most, he exercised humility. He knew he could not build a ship himself so he entrusted Floki. A great leader utilizes the strengths and weaknesses of the people around him to great effect. Arrogant and short-sighted leaders think they can do everything better than anyone else and take credit for others’ success. We’ve all had bosses like that. Did you respect them? Did that behaviour make you want to work harder and better? Probably not. Ragnar knew that he must exercise humility and respect for those below him.</p><br>
                    <h2>Be Ruthless in your Commitment</h2>
                    <p>Ruthlessness. As a millennial, we have a tendency to lack commitment. We make decisions and change our mind. We make promises and break them. We have a “FOMO” or fear of missing out. We detest any sort of commitment in case something better comes along, because if we commit then they might think we actually care. We’re flaky. In our daily life, we are half-in. Ragnar is never half-in. He is always committed to his cause, his decisions, and his purpose. He makes a decision and commits to it with ruthlessness. His friends, his family, his enemies, they can all agree on one thing — he cares. He puts his passion and energy into committing his thoughts into action.</p>
